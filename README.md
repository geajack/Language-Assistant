# Wordology

Ask any non-native speaker how they learned to speak such good English, and you'll generally get a response involving watching
movies with subtitles, playing video games online, or living in an English-speaking country. You don't learn a language in order to use it,
you learn a language *by* using it.

**Wordology** is a browser add-on for Chrome and Firefox intended to help turn your foreign-language reading from homework into a natural
part of your routine. Inspired by [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/) and [FLTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fltr/), Wordology allows you to add translations for individual words and display them with
a simple mouse-over.

Wordology takes the point of view that language learning is largely a *quest for words* (a phrase coined by Lingq's Steve Kaufmann).
Although learning grammar and idioms is daunting as well, it's my experience that by far the biggest hurdle in learning a language are
the thousands of words that have to be learned before you can understand the language with any degree of fluency. Wordology is not a translation
app: it's a progress tracker for your quest for words.

**Features**
- Words are color coded: red for undefined, and green for words that you've added to your dictionary, letting you visualize your progress.
- Wordology will attempt to automatically detect variants of words in your dictionary (plural nouns, conjugated verbs, etc).
- Word list can be exported as JSON for conversion to other file formats such as Anki flash card decks (conversion software not included!).
