# Wordology

Ask any non-native speaker how they learned to speak such good English, and you'll generally get a response involving watching
movies with subtitles, playing video games online, or living in an English-speaking country. You don't learn a language in order to use it,
you learn a language *by* using it.

**Wordology** is a browser add-on for Chrome and Firefox intended to help turn your foreign-language reading from homework into a natural
part of your routine. Inspired by [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/) and [FLTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fltr/), Wordology allows you to add translations for individual words and display them with
a simple mouse-over.

Wordology takes the point of view that language learning is largely a *quest for words* (a phrase coined by Lingq's Steve Kaufmann).
Although learning grammar and idioms is daunting as well, it's my experience that by far the biggest hurdle in learning a language are
the thousands of words that have to be learned before you can understand the language with any degree of fluency. Wordology is not a translation
app: it's a progress tracker for your quest for words.

**Features**
- Words are color coded: red for undefined, and green for words that you've added to your dictionary, letting you visualize your progress.
- Wordology will attempt to automatically detect variants of words in your dictionary (plural nouns, conjugated verbs, etc).
- Word list can be exported as JSON for conversion to other file formats such as Anki flash card decks (conversion software not included!).

# How to use

Once the add-on is installed, load any web page in your target language and click the Wordology button in the top-right corner of your browser. All words on the page will be highlighted in red. Click on any word to add a translation for it. From now on, on any web page, that word will be displayed in green, and you can view your translation just by hovering the mouse over it. **Note: Wordology currently only supports the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.** Please post on the issue tracker here or send an e-mail to wordologyaddon@gmail.com if you would like support for other writing systems.

## Changing Wordology settings, viewing wordlist

Wordology's behavior can be fine tuned from the settings page. How to access the settings page depends on the browser.

From this page you can also view and edit your saved words. More help on these features is available in the options page.
